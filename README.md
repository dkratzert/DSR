DSR
===

The program DSR consists of a text database with fragments of molecules and the DSR program. 
It acts as a preprocessor for SHELXL .res files. The user inserts a special command in the SHELXL .res file 
and the DSR program reads this information to put a molecule or fragment with the desired atoms on the position 
of the target atoms or q-peaks in the unit cell. Bond restraints can be either applied from the database to the molecule 
or automatically generated.
