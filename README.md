DSR
===

The program consists of a simple text database with fragments of molecules and the DSR program. 
It acts as a preprocessor for SHELXL .res files. The user inserts a special command in the SHELXL .res file 
and the DSR program reads this information to put a molecule or fragment with the desired atoms on the position 
of the target atoms specified by the user. Bond restraints are applied from the database to the molecule. 
Future versions will also generate additional restraints automatically.
