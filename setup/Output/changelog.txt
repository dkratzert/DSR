Recent changes
-1.5.13 Improved error logging. Implemented Support for negative atomic number for atom type. Fixed some typos in 
        the database.
-1.5.12 Fixed bug in replace mode.
-1.5.11 Ignore lines starting with # in the DB. Python3 compatible again. Lower case resi fixed. Exceptions get logged.
        Several improvements for external restraints.
-1.5.10 External restraints without residues are now supported. Small fixes.
-1.5.9  DSR now warns if data to paramter ratio is getting bad. small fixes.
-1.5.8  Support for both types of SFAC. Search result of -s also with line number. More tests.
-1.5.7  DSR now creates a backup file before fragment fit in a separate directory. 
        Exported fragment res files now include database restraints.
-1.5.6  Program renamed to "Disordered Structure Refinement (DSR)" Small fixes. Warning about inacurate restraints.
-1.5.5  Unit tests. Small fixes.
-1.5.4  Code cleanup and deletion from adjacent hydrogen atoms improved.
-1.5.3  Recognition of dsr command improved.
-1.5.2  Fixed incorrect handling of lower-case residues.
-1.5.1  Fixed handling of atom names like C0W0. Exception handling for missing dsr command fixed.
-1.5.0  New option "-s" to search for fragments in the database. Improved file formating.
-1.4.6  Fixed negative part numbers.
-1.4.5  Introduced the ability to invert the fragment (-t option). Simplified startup script for windows.
        Splitted export to clipboard (-c option) and to res/png file (-e option) in two options.
-1.4.4  small db updates, small fix in error handling.
-1.4.3  very long lines of restraints were not correctly wrapped.
-1.4.2  serious bug with wrong naming scheme of fragment atoms fixed.
-1.4.1  serious bug with wrapped lines in the database header fixed.
-1.4.0  Big database update (Many thanks to Ilia A. Guzei providing molecular fragments). The automatic generation 
        of DFIX/DANG and FLAT restraints with the "DFIX" DSR-command is now implemented. 
        Success and fail reports about the restraint generation would be highly appreciated!
        Separate files with restraints e.g. in a +FILENAME.dfx file are now implemented (system 
        command line option -re). Full fragment names are now listed with "dsr -l". The output of -l
        now automatically fits to the command line width.
        More meaningful comments about the import from a GRADE fragment are now included during the import 
        and export. Multiple lines of REM in the database are now supported. 
        The molecules of the paper about "X-ray analysis on the nanogram to microgram scale using porous complexes"
        from Inokuma, Y. et al. Nature 495, 461–466 (2013) are included!
-1.3.2  FRAG in the database entrys was accidentally case sensitive. A missing residue in the database 
        entry was not properly checked.
-1.3.1  A lot of improvements: DFIX command now possible without RESI command. line wrap of long command 
        lines and lines of restraints now fully working. Export to clipboard of experimental coordinates now 
        working correctly. Networkx added to distribution.
-1.3.0  First implementation of automatic generated DFIX restraints.
-1.2.13 Restraints for same residue classes are now inserted only once. Port to Python-3.3
-1.2.12 Small fixes and new Linux packages.
-1.2.11 Supports now multiple lines of FVAR. DSR command line in res file is now correctly wrapped 
        during processing with DSR bevor exceeding 80 characters.
-1.2.10	Much improved error handling for shelxl. In case of shelx errors the original 
        res file is restored now. The B array size is now set according to the number of atoms.	
-1.2.9	Minor improvement in export. Better esds in the database.	
-1.2.8	Fixed bug where sometimes atom names were case sensitive.	
-1.2.7	A few improvements in the database. Small bugfixes.	
-1.2.6	Olex2 macro was not working. Export inside Olex2 still does not work in 64bit windows. 
        Will be fixed later.	
-1.2.5	Fixed bug where db content was printed to screen instead of the db name when no restraints 
        are in a db entry.	
-1.2.4	export of a fragment now copies also to the clipboard. This can be used with the "match" 
        functionality of Olex2.	
-1.2.3	better GRADE import directly from the .tgz file. Lots of small imporovements.	
-1.2.2	small fixes	
-1.2.1	nicer output	
-1.2.0	Support for Grade import, more fragments, better output listing from "dsr -l", better error 
        handling. Please uninstall the previous version (<= 1.1.3 ) completely bevore installing 
        Version > 1.2.0	
-1.1.2	fix for lowercase atom names	
-1.1.1	Small corrections in the Windows setup process.	
-1.1.0	Step by step example in the manual and example files in the package.	
-1.0.6	files with no AFIX are now handled correctly	
-1.0.5	small fix to handle the AFIX 9 after an AFIX mn correctly.	
-1.0.4	DSR was not able to find xl.exe.	
-1.0.3	Linux package now with unix line endings.	
-1.0.2	new dsr makros for Olex2 (custom.xld)	
-1.0.1	better OlexDSR.py for Olex2	
-1.0.0	full support for residues in target atom notation e.g. C12_1. DSR finds a unique residue 
        number if no number is given, warns if residue number already in use und finds a uniq. 
        Adjacent hydrogen atoms are deleted in replace mode.
