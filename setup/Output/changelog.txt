-214    Fixed external restraints with Kabsch fit
-213    Added fragment fit with Kabsch algorithm instead of FRAG/FEND fit. This runs much faster for large structures. 
        This version might be unstable and not all features are suported, but regular fragment fit with or without 
        RESIdues and PARTs work.
-212    Fixed SFAC with exponential parameters. Teflat fragment added. Added Trifluorbenzene. 
-211    More fragments: Dimethyl ammonium, tert-Butyl isocyanide, improved replace mode.
-210    Added check for DFIX/DANG if the d value is larger than the sigma (as it should be). DSR now ignores
        fragments that do not contain atoms. Less output during fragment fit (wR2 and Gof were useless).
        Fixed line endings in start script. This should fix updates on Unix systems.
-209    Added 4,4'-Di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine and TEMPO fragments, users manual updated esp. residues
        chapter, optimized restraints, fixed Acetonitrile restraints (why did nobody noticed this?).
-208    Changed self-update process to be secured by checksums and ssl.
-207    When using residues, DSR will now introduce a SAME_name 'first atom' > 'last atom'
        to the list of restraints. First/last atom means first and last atom from the
        respective fragment. This will make distances in all residues more consisten but should
        do no harm.
        Restructured dbfile.py a lot. Acess to the text database is now clearer and the parser
        easyer to read.
-206    Added Thiophen and 1,2,3,4-Tetrafluorobenzene.
-205    Added SO2. Added full SHELXL-2017/1 compatibility (Except for chain IDs). Fixed
        restraints in acetonitrile.
-204    Added Methyl tert-butyl ether to the DB. Small fix for CF3 groups. Refractured
        some code.
-203    Added logfile 'dsr-log.lst' to dsr output. Every last dsr run is now in the
        'dsr-log.lst' file. Improved detection of already used restraints. The standard
        deviations are now ignored for detection of duplicate restraints. This prevents
        adding new restraints although they are alredy there but with different values.
        Added two more ether conformers (zigzag and only one side angled).
-202    Greatly improved search results of "dsr -s name". A bug prevented to display
        very similar names in the search results.
-201    Fixed bug in threefold disordered CF3 group. Fixed -target option. Q-peaks
        with -target can now have duplicate names. Removed FLAT in alkanes.
-200-1  Added missing python27.dll in Windows package. Fixes "unknown error" in 
        ShelXle GUI (Thanks to Christoph Wölper).
-200    Startup speed improvements. Added possibility to define target position 
        of atoms as coordinates (-target option“).
-199    Added documentation how to control DSR with an external user interface.
        Hexamethyl benzene fragment added. DSR inserts a comment about the origin
        of the fragment into the res file.
-198    Fixed some error messages. Added Leucine and Lysine. Improved search behavior.
        Improved sorting of fragment list. Added [SbF6]-. SFAC names are now case insensitive.
-197-1  2,6-Dichlorobenzene added.
-197    Fixed bug that prevents using more than nine free variables. Added
        Dichloroethane and TMEDA fragments, RSS-Feed, unit tests, more search
        results. 
-196    Improved C20, C60 and C70 fragments. Now they all have restraints and
        optimized geometry. Fixed case sensitivity bug. Improved FLAT restraints.
        Added CF3, CF6 and CF9 fragments as dummys to the database.
        Improved unit tests.
-195    Slight speed improvement. Cleaner code (needs more cleaning). Fixed too 
        optimistic replace mode in 194. External restraints shouuld work again.
-194    Fixed ANSI escape codes appearing in ShelXle GUI. Improved updater.
-193    Added auto updater to DSR. Run "dsr -u" to update to the most recent version.
-192    Fixed strange characters in fragment list in Linux and other Small fixes.
-191    Prevent ** NEGATIVE OCCUPANCY FOR ATOM XX  ** warning in case of wrong 
        free variable values before fit. Added Isopropanole. Optimized examples.
        Updated user manual. Fixed minor problem in case no shelxl executable is
        found during fit in ShelXle.
-190    Fixed TypeError when using split and cf6.
-189    Improved GRADE import. Fixed bug regarding calculated FLAT restraints.
-188    Fixed bug that produces  "dsr: error: unrecognized arguments: [...]" if
        SHELXL was located in a directory containing space characters.
        Fixed bug where "FVAR 1" ended up as 1000000.
        Added all natural amino acids. Improved FLAT restraints. 
-187    No CF3 groups inside of residues allowed any more. Fixed exception when 
        DSR tries to delete a file.
        MAC OS: Fixed broken startup script.
-186    Fixed bug in sorting of names list. Made outlier test for SADI a bit weaker.
        Added Fluorobenzene. User manual update.
-185    Added COD to database. Fixed bug where cf3fit could delete the first atom
        in the res file (Thanks to C. Maichle-Moessmer for reporting). Fixed
        damaging of L.S. command with more than one parameter.
-184    PMDETA and DMAP fragments added, Fixed bug where cf3fit could not handle 
        isotropic atoms (Thanks to C. Maichle-Moessmer for reporting).
-183    New fragments, improved handling of relative paths for external restraints,
        restore refinement cycles after DSR run. 
-182    IMPORTANT! The default path for the user database is now the users home
        directory! For example /home/username/dsr_user_db.txt in Linux and 
        C:/users/Username in windows Vista and later. The DSR_DB_DIr environment
        variable is now deprecated.
        This version of DSR is not compatible with the DSR GUI in ShelXle-1.0.758
        and below!
        ShelXle 758 expects the user database file in the DSR directory while later
        versions will expect it in the users home directory.
        The fragment names in the listing output are now mostly sorted correctly.
        An unreadable SHELXL executable will not create an exeption any more.
-181    Fixed bug where external restraints produced "illegal instruction" error
        in SHELXL. AFIX 9 and +dfixfile is now recognized by a unique id.
        External restraints with a rigid group produced an invalid RESI None None 
        instruction.
-180    Moving version format to integer. Final export format for the ShelXle GUI. 
        Faster start in Windows. Many small fixes. Improved error messages.
        In replace mode, really delete lines instead of producing blank lines. 
        User manual updates.
-1.7.7  New output format for DSRGui. New command line option for rigid group.

        Added Anthracene and 9,10-Dibromoanthracene.
        Better formating of DFIX/DANG list with dfix option turned on.
        Fixed bug with occ=0.25
        Addedd C60 (with restraints) and C70 (without restraints, use dfix option).
        Some more unit tests.
-1.7.3  Small fix regarding FVAR with CF6 fragment. 
-1.7.2  Added [2.2.2]-cryptand to database. Tanks to Dejan Premuzic! Added Ability

-1.7.1  Fixed typos in CF3 restraints. Improved residue handling with CF3 groups.
        Known bugs: res files without FVAR (e.g. after shelxs or shelxt) cause a 
        crash.
-1.7.0  New feature: Ability to model disordered CF3 groups (1, 2 and 3 positions). 
        Fixed CF6 restraints.

-1.6.1  New feature: replace mode will replace all atoms in PART 0 that are 1.2 A 
        near the fitting fragment. Please tell me if 1.2 A is too far.
        New fragment 18-Crown-6 (thanks to Dejan Premu�ic), New fragment Mesitylene. 
        Bug fixed that introduced
        restraints again, even if they were already there (thanks to Olaf Petersen).
        Better warning for bad residues. Several small fixes. ACTA card is restored 
        as it was before now.
        Triphenylphosphane added to database. Fixed replacing of residues.
-1.6.0  Completely changed DFIX/DANG/FLAT routines. Connectivity list is now 
        calculated by DSR and not from .lst file (SHELXL).
        FLAT also includes neighbouring ring atoms. Exported res files now include 
        DFIX/DANG/FLAT restraints. Please report bugs in this release.

        fragments). The automatic generation
        of DFIX/DANG and FLAT restraints with the "DFIX" DSR-command is now implemented.
        Success and fail reports about the restraint generation would be highly 
        appreciated!
        Separate files with restraints e.g. in a +FILENAME.dfx file are now implemented 
        (system command line option -re). Full fragment names are now listed with 
        "dsr -l". The output of -l
        now automatically fits to the command line width.
        More meaningful comments about the import from a GRADE fragment are now 
        included during the import
        and export. Multiple lines of REM in the database are now supported.
        The molecules of the paper about "X-ray analysis on the nanogram to microgram 
        scale using porous complexes"
        from Inokuma, Y. et al. Nature 495, 461�466 (2013) are included!
